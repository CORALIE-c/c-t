color, quantity, price, and the related products
everything else we can get later in the checkout process
it would be nice if the related products like deposit slips, binders, stamps etc.. could all be added off that one page
and if it can show a subtotal for the products like the pdf file shows
it would be nice if they can choose cheque style.." TOP, MIDDLE" or BOTTTOM"
and then color, so the image on the left chagnes based on those selections.

Here are the steps were looking for
1) go to this page select products and see prices
2) go to checkout page using this zencart module
https://www.numinix.com/zen-cart-modules/checkout/fast-and-easy-checkout-for-zen-cart?zenid=9015488aaddd9ee2b001d283803d3c4d
on that page they can register as a new user or checkout as a guest or login if they are a past customer
3) once registered or logged in they are taken through the checkout process for billing/shipping and payment

For shipping we will need to use all 3 shipping modules... Canpar, Canada Post & UPS
For the payment we need to use the zencart modules BEANSTREAM for interac, and Blue pay for credit card
also on the checkout page, we will need the option for them to pay for RUSH service $25

once they have made their shipping choices and paid via beanstream or blue pay. I then would want them taken to a new page that gives them 3 options to submit their cheque deatils
on that page they will be able to 1) Scan and email a copy of your current cheque (with a box where they can enter any changes)
2) Go fill in the online order form (that we use now)
3) Fax us a copy of their current cheque

Also, once they have paid for their order, i want to use the PDF invoice module in Zencart, so they can print of their invoice and so we can have a copy of it as well... there are zencart modules for that
im assuming that zencart tracks all orders online, and that order and shipping details can be downloaded in .csv files?
Anyways... so that is the process we are trying to do
So instead of filling in the online order form 1st, we would have them fill it in after they have checkout out etc...
